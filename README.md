# seasonalWallpaper
Script to change wallpaper depending on the season, and time of day.
After searching for this I found a few overcomplicated plugins for doing something that was well within reach of an amateur dev and far simpler.

Requires a master folder containing a subfolder of pictures for each season, and one for night with 2 subfolders for snowy and non-snowy pictures

Python script doesn't play nice with crontab, in the process of translating it to bash.
